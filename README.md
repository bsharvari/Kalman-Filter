# Kalman-Filter
Multi-dimensional Kalman filter for localization

Basic matrix operations like generation of identity matrix, addition, sutraction, multiplication of two marices, and transpose of a matrix are implemented in a separate class. The Kalman filter is implemented using equations for multiple dimensions. The code is tested for sample input where the robot is in a 2-dimensional world, so it has both motion and velocity in x and y, making it a 4-dimensional problem.
